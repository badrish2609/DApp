🩺 Decentralized Health Monitoring System (DApp)
This project aims to build a decentralized health monitoring system that combines the power of AI-based health risk prediction, blockchain security, and encrypted patient-doctor interactions into one seamless, privacy-preserving platform.

🚀 Project Overview
Our system is designed to:

Predict potential health risks (such as diabetes or hypertension) using patient vitals.

Securely store and manage sensitive health data using blockchain and smart contracts.

Enable encrypted, transparent doctor-patient interactions via a decentralized digital interface.

Notify patients about their upcoming appointments through automated email alerts.

🧠 How It Works – Architecture Snapshot
🔹 Data Collection & Preprocessing:
Patient health vitals including Age, Gender, Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP), Glucose level, and BMI are collected and normalized for consistency.

🔹 AI-Powered Risk Assessment:
A Transformer-based encoder-decoder model extracts deep patterns from the preprocessed data. Deployed at the fog layer, this model performs real-time inference to assess potential health risks dynamically.

🔹 Blockchain Integration:

Predictions and health insights are recorded on a Blockchain Ledger ensuring immutability and traceability.

Smart Contracts, developed in Solidity, govern access permissions and data routing through multi-factor authenticated gateways.

🔹 Cloud & Privacy Layer:
The system leverages encrypted cloud storage to securely hold patient reports and diagnostic data. Access is managed through role-based smart contracts, preserving privacy while maintaining transparency.

🔹 User Interaction & Notifications:
Patients and doctors can interact with the system through a secure, decentralized interface. Additionally, Email.js is integrated to automatically notify patients about their upcoming appointments, improving reliability and patient engagement.

🛠️ Tech Stack
